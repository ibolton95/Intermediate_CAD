## Advanced and Mechanical Mates
Created box-like parts to be put in Advanced and Mechanical Mates Assembly. Reflection: The different configurations were slightly challenging at first, but, with help, I eventually made the boxes.

## Advanced and Mechanical Mates Assembly
Combined Pin and Advanced and Mechanical Mates parts to make a sliding box-like assembly. Reflection: I had some trouble using the correct mating tool for a certain purpose, but I eventually figured it out.
